R-9.2 Suppose you set the key for each position p of a binary tree T equal to 
its preorder rank. Under what circumstances is T a heap?

Answer
------
T is a heap when any parent position is lesser or equal the value position 
and it is a complete binary tree.

Example 1 (proper and complete binary tree):

            1
    2               5
3       4       6       7


Example 2 (proper and complete binary tree yet):

            1
    2               4
3       5
