R-14.13 Explain why the DFS traversal runs in O(n 2 ) time on an n-vertex simple graph
that is represented with the adjacency matrix structure.

Answer:
======

As DFS is a discover algorithm, when is used an adjacency matrix structure, it 
is necessary go through every vertices (columns) for each vertex (rows) to find 
its adjacency vertices (non null elements).
