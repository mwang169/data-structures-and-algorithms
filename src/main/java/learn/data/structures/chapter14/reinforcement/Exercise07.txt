R-14.7 Give pseudocode for performing the operation insertEdge(u, v, x) in O(1) time
using the adjacency matrix representation.

Answer:
======

An adjacency matrix, for instance:

       0 1 2 3
A -> 0
B -> 1
C -> 2
D -> 3

Pseudo-code:

insertEdge(A, B, edge) 
    matrix[A][B] = edge
    matrix[B][A] = edge


The adjacency matrix after insertion (e = edge):

       0 1 2 3
A -> 0   e
B -> 1 e
C -> 2
D -> 3
