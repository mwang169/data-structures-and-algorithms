R-11.4 Dr. Amongus claims that the order in which a fixed set of entries is inserted 
into a binary search tree does not matterâ€”the same tree results every time. Give a
small example that proves he is wrong.

Answer:
======
Given a set of keys:
{1, 2, 3}

Given two insertion sequences:
1st -> 1, 2, 3
2nd -> 3, 2, 1

The respective results are:

1st
---
1
 \
  2
   \
    3

2nd
---
    3
   /
  2
 /
1

It is possible notice that both results are different.
