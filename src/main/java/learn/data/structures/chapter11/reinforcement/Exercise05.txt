R-11.5 Dr. Amongus claims that the order in which a fixed set of entries is inserted 
into an AVL tree does not matterâ€”the same AVL tree results every time. Give a small
example that proves he is wrong.

Answer:
======
Given a set of keys:
{1, 2, 3, 4}

Given two insertion sequences:
1st -> 1, 2, 3, 4
2nd -> 4, 3, 2, 1 

The respective results are:
1st
---
  2
 / \
1   3
     \
      4

2nd
---
    3
   / \
  2   4
 /
1

It is possible notice that both results are different.
