R-11.17 Is the search tree of Figure 11.22(a) a (2, 4) tree? Why or why not?

Answer:
======
               22
            /     \
         /           \
      5   10            25
     /  |  \            / \
   /    |    \        /     \
 3 4   6 8    14   23 24     27
             /  \
           /      \ 
        11 13     17

Despite all internal nodes have at most four children, this search tree isn't 
a (2, 4) tree because not all external nodes have the same depth.
